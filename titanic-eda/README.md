# Titanic EDA Project

## Overview
The Titanic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to extract insights regarding passenger demographics and their survival rates. By leveraging various data visualization and statistical techniques, this project aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that contributed to survival outcomes.

## Project Description
The Titanic dataset comprises information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank on April 15, 1912. The primary objective of this project is to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis to identify and understand the factors that influenced the likelihood of survival.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0).
- **Pclass**: Represents the ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: The name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger at the time of boarding.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number assigned to the passenger.
- **Fare**: The fare paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number assigned to the passenger (if applicable).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C for Cherbourg, Q for Queenstown, S for Southampton).

## Goals
The project aims to:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- Visualize key trends and distributions within the data.
- Analyze correlations between different features and survival rates.
- Draw meaningful conclusions based on statistical findings.

## Insights
Through this analysis, we hope to reveal significant insights such as:
- The impact of gender on survival rates.
- The effect of socio-economic status as indicated by ticket class.
- Age-related trends in survival likelihood.

## Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis serves as a foundational step towards understanding the dynamics of survival on the Titanic. The insights gained can inform further predictive modeling or deeper statistical investigations into historical maritime disasters.
