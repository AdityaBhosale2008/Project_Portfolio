# Boston House Price Prediction

## Overview
The Boston House Price Prediction project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that predicts housing prices in the Boston area based on various features of the properties and their surroundings. This project leverages data science methodologies to assist homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions.

## Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to accurately predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset, which includes various factors that influence property values. The analysis focuses on understanding the relationships between these features and the target variable, which is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- **TAX**: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000.
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **B**: A calculated value representing the proportion of Black residents by town.
- **LSTAT**: Percentage lower status of the population.
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in thousands of dollars.

## Goals
The project aims to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.
- Preprocess and clean the data for modeling.
- Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict house prices accurately.

## Insights
Preliminary analysis indicates that key factors influencing house prices include:
- Areas with low crime rates.
- Proximity to the Charles River.
- The average number of rooms in a dwelling.
- The age and condition of neighborhoods.

## Conclusion
The Boston House Price Prediction project successfully develops a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various influential features. The model demonstrates high accuracy, making it a valuable tool for stakeholders in the real estate market. Future work may involve enhancing model performance through advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning or exploring additional datasets for more comprehensive insights.
